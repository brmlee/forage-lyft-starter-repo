The new tire wear sensors produce an array of four numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive, representing how worn each of the tires are.
This array will be passed to each function in the car factory class, to be used by your tire implementation.
Carrigan tires should be serviced only when one or more of the values in the tire wear array is greater than or equal to 0.9.
Octoprime tires should be serviced only when the sum of all values in the tire wear array is greater than or equal to 3.
Think carefully about the cleanest way to implement the new tire service criteria, then modify the system to complete the change.
